# Packages Directory

This directory contains pre-built OPKG packages organized by architecture.

## Directory Structure

```
packages/
├── all/       # Architecture-independent packages
├── arm/       # ARM architecture packages
├── mips/      # MIPS architecture packages
└── x86_64/    # x86_64 architecture packages
```

## Contents

Each architecture directory contains:
- `.ipk` files - Pre-built OPKG packages (committed to git)
- `Packages` - Package index (plain text, auto-generated)
- `Packages.gz` - Compressed package index (auto-generated)

## Package Index

The `Packages` and `Packages.gz` files contain metadata for all packages in the directory:
- Package name and version
- Architecture
- Dependencies
- Description
- File size and checksums

These index files are automatically generated by GitHub Actions and are **not committed to git** (they are excluded via .gitignore).

## Adding to OPKG

Add the appropriate architecture feed to your Enigma2 receiver:

```bash
# For architecture-independent packages
src/gz cockpit https://codeisus.github.io/Cockpit/packages/all

# For ARM
src/gz cockpit-arm https://codeisus.github.io/Cockpit/packages/arm

# For MIPS
src/gz cockpit-mips https://codeisus.github.io/Cockpit/packages/mips

# For x86_64
src/gz cockpit-x86_64 https://codeisus.github.io/Cockpit/packages/x86_64
```

Then update and install:

```bash
opkg update
opkg install <package-name>
```

## Notes

- Pre-built packages (`.ipk` files) are committed to git
- Package indexes are automatically generated by GitHub Actions
- See [USAGE.md](../USAGE.md) for user documentation
- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to submit packages
